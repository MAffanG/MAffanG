## About Me
Hey there 👋 I’m Affan, someone who believes that curiosity isn’t just a trait — it’s fuel.
I love exploring why things work, not just how.

Currently diving deep into Spring Boot and React, learning to build things that feel balanced and impactful.
There’s always more to a thing than just luck. ✨
